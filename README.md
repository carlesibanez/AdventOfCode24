# AdventOfCode24

This repo contains my code to solve the [2024 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024). The solutions are implemented in Python and tested in a virtual environment on Python 3.8.10. 

This repo is structured in the same way as [AdventOfCode22](https://github.com/carlesibanez/AdventOfCode22). For more info about file structure, code usage and replicability, refer to that repo.
